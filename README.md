# Booklet-PharoVirtualMachine

[![Build status][badge]][travis]

This repository contains the early draft of a book documenting the internal aspects of the Pharo VM. 
We are writing Unit Tests and from this knowledge we run sprint sessions and document. 

To avoid misunderstanding we acknoledge that the original design of the Pharo Virtual Machine (Cog+Spur)
is the work on E. Miranda and with some parts done by C. BÃ©ra. Our intention is to document it so that everybody
can understand it. 

The errors in this document are ours. Of course, we would have preferred to read a good documentation instead
of reverse enginering it. Now if you happen to know that we wrote mistakes (which will certainly happen) please
let us know. 

Since we are not a native english speaker, we appreciate pull requests that help me get the material in better form.
