This book is a work in progress to document the Pharo Virtual Machine. 
We are doing it to collect and structure the knowledge we are learning and sharing with you. 
Most of the design of the Pharo virtual machine has been made by E. Miranda. 
Now our effort is to document it so that a larger amount of people can understand and in the future
modify it. We are also using as input the posts of C. BÃ©ra.

Now it may happen that we wrote something wrong and this is because we are learning. 
If you spot something wrong, please let us know.

The booklet on concurrent programming in Pharo also describes some VM primitives and provide some 
specific information. We are also working on a documentation of the compiler.
