Ephemerons
==========

Ephemerons are used to finalize the objects that require them. 
The ephemerons are signaled when the key of the ephemeron is collected.

During the scavenge the ephemerons are kept in a linked list from the last one to the first, the links are constructed by using the offset inside the past space of the corpses (the now dead ephemerons). This is stored in the ephemeronList.

When the ephemeron if fired it is changed to a normal object, and all the references of it are visited. 
The key of the ephemeron is not set to nil.

The mournQueue can be accessed using #dequeueMourner

Tests to add:

 - Many weaks so we test the weaklist.
 - Many ephemerons with la large ephemeron lists.
 - Mourn queue has to expand.
 - Ephemeron in the Eden, EPhemeron in the past.
