A free chunk has some slots:

1) Next
2) Preview
3) Parent
4) Smaller
5) Larger

When the memory is initialized the free space is in a single big chunk. 
The big chunk is initialized with all the slots in 0.

If we release a new free chunk, the free chunk is linked in the free tree.
As the head of the free tree is bigger it will put it in the smaller pointer.

The parent of the newly created free chunk points to the original free chunk root.

See test #testChildNodeShouldHaveRootAsParent.

The pointers in the tree are all OOP, because it has to be able to handle longer objects with extra headers. 

Deallocating a piece will not change the root. 
We have to check if it is kept balanced or not.
The free chunks are put left and right, left for smallers and right for biggers.
